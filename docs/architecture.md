# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the Football League Analytics architecture, explaining the key components and how they interact.

## High-level Architecture

Football League Analytics is a client-side React application built with modern web technologies. The application follows a component-based architecture with a focus on reusability, maintainability, and performance.

## Key Technologies

- **React**: UI library for building component-based interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library built on top of Tailwind
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing
- **Tanstack Query**: For data fetching and cache management
- **Recharts**: For data visualization

## Application Structure

### Core Layers

1. **UI Layer**
   - Components: React components that make up the user interface
   - Pages: Top-level components that represent different routes in the application

2. **State Management**
   - Context API: For global state management
   - Hooks: Custom hooks for component-specific state

3. **Data Layer**
   - Services: API client and data access functions
   - Utilities: Helper functions for data manipulation

4. **Routing Layer**
   - React Router: For handling navigation between pages

└── data/             # Static data & mock datasets
```

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with a component
2. Component calls a hook or service function
3. Data is fetched or manipulated
4. State is updated
5. Components re-render with the new state

## Component Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components should be designed for reuse where possible
- **Composability**: Complex components should be composed of simpler components
- **Accessibility**: Components should be accessible to all users

## State Management

We use React's Context API for global state management, with custom hooks to provide a clean API for accessing and updating state. For server state management, we use Tanstack Query to handle caching, refetching, and background updates.

## Performance Considerations

- Component memoization using `React.memo` for expensive components
- Virtualization for long lists
- Code splitting for larger bundles
- Image optimization for better performance
